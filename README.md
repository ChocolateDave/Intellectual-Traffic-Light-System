# Intellectual-Traffic-Light-System
## Introduction
This is a NUIETP sponsored project by Administration of Education, PRC. The main purpose of this project is to construct a robust and intelligent traffic light control system, with state-of-art machine learning techniques. 
All rights of this project are reserved by college of Transportation Engineering at Tongji University and college of Software Engineering at Tongji University. Special thanks to German Aerospace Centre (DLR) for their generously support on our team.
